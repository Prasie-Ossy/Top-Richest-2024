I load the 2024 top richest people dataset (500 records). I create staging tables, confirm zero duplicates, verify distinct industries/countries, check for nulls/blanks (none), and finalize clean columns. I run full EDA: top industry (Technology 138), leading country (United States 267), max YTD gain (Elon Musk +$218B), highest positive last change (Larry Page +$7.85B), worst last change (Amancio Ortega -$7.41B), and sorted lists of non-zero changes by name/country/industry. I produce a fully cleaned, ready-to-use richest people table.
